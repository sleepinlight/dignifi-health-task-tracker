## Steps for running this application

1. clone `sample.env` to create a `.env` file in the root directory. The `TOKEN_KEY` value within can be any string you like.
2. run `npm install` in the root directory.
3. In a second terminal, run `npm install` in the `/server` directory.
4. Ensure you have nothing running on ports `3000` and `3004`.
5. run `npm start` in your terminal at the root directory, and do the same in the second terminal instance for the `/server`.
6. After both apps are up and running, you can access the Front-End in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
